<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Matteus J Guerra, Future Software Dev, 
  Current Pinball Wizard</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is my first Full length Software development class! I was taught some very basic python many years ago and took a very short class a few months ago in preperation
  But overall i have had no experience with developing software before now! I cannot wait for future projects in class!</li>
<li>Everyone in my immediate family is currently working of Software Development but my ownly job experience has either been in Food Service or Customer service in the Form of Major Sales during my time at
  Costco Wholesale. I learned more about hardware than software there, though writing code reminds me of the UI Costco uses to keep track of everting in the wharehouse, so this does come semi-naturally</li>
<li>My current goals class-wise are to soak up as much information as i possibly can, constantly improving and using others critisism and assistance to help me strive for perfection in what i do.</li>
